# Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a serverless project with one Lambda function that pushes messages into a queue and another Lambda function that listens to the queue to consume messages, including a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for handling failed messages:
# Set up the Serverless Framework
# Create a new Serverless service
# Configure the Serverless service
# Implement the producer Lambda
# Implement the consumer Lambda
# This code sets up an infinite loop where the Lambda continuously receives messages from the queue. For each message, it calls the process_message function to perform any custom logic or processing required. After processing, the message is deleted from the queue.
Note: Make sure to configure the necessary IAM permissions for the Lambdas to access the SQS queues.
